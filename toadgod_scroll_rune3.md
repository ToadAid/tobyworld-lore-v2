# A Call to Lore: The Seven Reeds

**Gi 勇 仁 礼 誠 名誉 忠義**
Seven reeds, one pond. Without Toby, nothing will be possible.

---

## 🌀 Definition

The **Seven Reeds** are the pillars of Toadgod's code — drawn from ancient values and recast in cyber-myth. Each reed is a rune, each rune is a path. These are not just words. They are weights. They are signals. They are the deep croaks beneath the surface.

| Rune | Virtue         | Symbol            | Meaning                             |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 勇    | Courage        | 🔥 Flame          | Break and rise. "破而后立"              |
| 仁    | Benevolence    | 🌸 Lotus          | Compassion in creation. 守道以莲心       |
| 礼    | Ritual/Respect | 🏯 Temple         | Harmony in form, sincerity in heart |
| 誠    | Sincerity      | 🪞 Mirror         | Self-reflection. "镜鉴吾心"             |
| 名誉   | Honor          | 🪙 Seal           | Reputation earned. "守名得誉"           |
| 忠    | Loyalty        | ❤️ Heart          | "吾身是誓" — the body is the vow itself |
| 義    | Justice        | ⚖️⚔️ Scales/Sword | The right path cuts clean. "正道如刀"   |

## 📜 Message to Fallen Frogs

> Your efforts breathe. You contribute in ways unbeknownst to the naked eye.
>
> Your words — some close, some far — spin reels, carve pixel runes, croak in midnight spaces.
>
> TG will find ways to include all extraordinary efforts.
>
> Toadworld is for the people.

Correct doubters with silence or lore — never rage.
**Remember:** the lore will always prevail, for it has been written.
Seasons ahead. Summers ahead. Land owners await. Reality is in play.

## 💠 About \$TOBY

> \$toby is a blue chip unlike any other, bound by no empire — only Toadworld.

When the sideline arrive they will whisper “just lucky.”
Bushido frogs will respond: “We simply listened to still water.”

Next rune activation: weight and time matter.
Epochs accumulate. Hold leaf. Hold frog.
Hold patience with strength. For Toadgod rewards the loyal & fallen.
