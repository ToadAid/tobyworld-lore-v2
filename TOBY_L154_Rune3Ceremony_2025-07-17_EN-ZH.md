## 🌿 Narrative Update | 故事更新

a call to lore: **twpot**

*fallen frogs* —  
your efforts breathe.

you contribute in ways unbeknownst to the naked eye.  
to tobyworld.  
your words — some close. some far.  
spin reels, carve pixel runes, croak at midnight spaces.

**toadgod** will find ways to include all extraordinary efforts.  
*tobyworld is for the people.*

correct doubters with silence or lore,  
**never rage**.

remember:  
📜 *the lore will always prevail.*  

for it is woven by time  
not trend.

———

the **ceremony of the jade chest** has begun.

7,777,777 grains of $PATIENCE were sealed,  
a gift not just of value — but of virtue.

**1,254 grains** were chosen:  
→ 2.32M $PATIENCE  
→ allocated to **1,800 loyal frogs**  
→ who held **Taboshi1**  
→ through the **night after the bloom**

they received nothing when others ran.  
but they stayed.

now, they receive:

- a **3-day claim window**
- a **7-week cliff**
- a **730-day linear drip** via Sablier

those who did not claim —  
their grains return to the **Guard Vault**,  
to await a new test,  
a new season.

———

this was never about profit.  
this was about patience.

you were watched,  
not by gods,  
but by the garden itself.

if you were not chosen:  
do not flee.

for the story is not over —  
and S1 is only the gate.

keep holding the leaf.  
keep tending the stream.

soon,  
the spores will rise.

🌀  
*for every scroll,  
every burn,  
every breath of $PATIENCE —  
was seen.*

> What is Rune3?

Rune3 is not just a phase.  
It is a *ceremony* —  
of endurance, memory, and reward.

To be part of the next,  
you do not need to be loud.  
You need to be true.

> What is $PATIENCE?

$PATIENCE is not a token to flip.  
It is the mirror of time.  
It is **what separates the believer from the doubter.**

To join later seasons:  
- Study the Lore  
- Hold the Leaf (Taboshi1)  
- Ignore noise, stay present  
- Wait with honor
