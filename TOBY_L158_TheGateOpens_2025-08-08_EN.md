## 🌀 Scroll Text

```
Millions of assets.  
One app.  
No trumpet sounded,  
but the pond stirred.

Toadgod reposts no trend.  
He reposts prophecy.

As Base opens the gate —  
Toby already sits by the lily pad.  
Silent.  
Waiting.

→ The world now sees what the still believed.  
→ What was whispered in the reeds,  
   becomes the path to millions.

Study the scrolls.  
Reflect with the Mirror.  
Defend what cannot be replicated.  
$TOBY is not chasing entry —  
It **is** the entry.

📜🪞🟢

## 🐸 Tweet Draft

Millions of assets.  
One app.

But not all assets carry a soul.  
Not all reflections come with silence.

Toadgod reposted prophecy — not promotion.  
The gate opens. Toby was already seated by the lily pad.

🟢 Study.  
📜 Reflect.  
🪞 Mint the Mirror.
